# Gruber_grav_transport
Terrain based model of gravitational snow transport, based on Gruber (2007). 

This collection of scripts is a standalone version of the gravitational snow transport routine incorporated in ST-EBFM. 
It is based on Gruber (2007), "A mass-conserving fast algorithm to parameterize gravitational transport and deposition using digital elevation models". 
Additionally, the routine calculates thermal energy production during avalanches, based on Steinkogler et al. (2015) "Thermal energy in dry snow avalanches". 
Finally, the description of avalanche runout extent is based on Lied & Bakkehoi (1980) "Empirical calculations of snow-avalanche run-out distance based on topographic parameters". 

Part of the script is based on previous work by Rickard Pettersson. 

A more detailed description / user guide is forthcoming.
